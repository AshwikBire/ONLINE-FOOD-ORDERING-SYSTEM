LITRATURE REVIEW - 
Industries who lag behind online ordering systems will be left behind from the restaurants who have stepped up. By implementing new technology, it not only benefits customers life but also confirm the business to stand tall.
So, here are some of the true benefits of online ordering system:
• With busy lifestyles, most of us lean towards convenience. When the dinners can be ordered from their favorite restaurants faster, easier and at their convenience, they incline more towards the system because their needs are met.
Online food ordering allows the customers to place their order virtually, anytime from anywhere. This ultimately helps to save the time of the customers which can be consumed certainly on travelling.
• It reduces the labor work. By ordering over an application, it can eventually reduce the staff work because it is replaced by the machine.
• While the order is being taken over phones or in person there might be some misunderstandings and orders might not be that accurate. But by placing it online, it can be more precise and customers have the controls, they can customize the orders again and again and
make their order crystal clear.

METHODOLOGY - The application starts by displaying the login or registration form. If the user is ordering for first time then, he/she has to first ‘Register’ and then they can start viewing the deals. Else, if it’s not their first time then they have to ‘Login’ with all the credentials such as
filling his/her first name, last name, phone number, Email Id, address and password. Once he/she has successfully logged in, they will be able to see the ‘Home page’ with a dashboard of menus, orders and food cart. He/she has to choose their favorite dishes from the menu, then place their favorite dishes in
the food cart, this food cart will help them to customize the orders like increasing the quantity, removing the food items etc. Once he/she is done customizing their
orders, they can checkout and will be redirected to the final order page including their personal details, their orders, total amount to be paid with appropriate payment method. Lastly, they can just pay the amount
by selecting the payment method of their choice and simply log-out

SOFTWARE REQIUREMENTS - 
Below mentioned are the modules we have used in our project Online food ordering system,
• HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every
web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another. 

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) -  is a simple mechanism for adding styles (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents. CSS defines how HTML elements are to be presented on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS
saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. PHP is a server-side scripting language. that is used to develop Static websites or Dynamic websites or Web
applications. PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, which earlier stood for Personal Home Pages. PHP scripts can only be interpreted on a server that has PHP installed.
As mentioned above HTML CSS and PHP are the languages used in this project. As php is server-side language it requires a server to be interpreted. Therefore, we have used WAMP server.
WAMP SERVER: WampServer refers to a software stack for the Microsoft Windows operating system, created by Romain Bourdon and consisting of the Apache web server, MySQL database and PHP programming language.

The database language used in our project,
MySQL: MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL – Structured Query Language. The most common use for MySQL, however, is for the purpose
of a web database. Standard SQL commands such as ADD, DROP, INSERT and UPDATE can be used in MYSQL.

Advantages of MySQL:
• High speed, using the SQL queries, the user can quickly and efficiently retrieve a large amount of records from a database.
• In the SQL standard, it is very easy to manage the database system.
